## What is this?

You may have come across some pages that says "404 Not Found". Well, that is a HTTP code which means the server has failed to get the requested file/page. There are other types of error codes which have their own meanings. This repo containes most of the Error Code's paegs but with Anime Pictures. Most of them are animated.
